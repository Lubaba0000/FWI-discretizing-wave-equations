# FWI-discretizing-wave-equations
is a domain-specific language (DSL) designed for the automated solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) using the finite difference method (FDM). It's particularly useful in the field of computational geophusics.In this case, it is particularly used to demonstrate full waveform inversion.
